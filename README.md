***Please Make Sure you are using Unity version 2020.1.11f1,
   Also make sure your commits to the main branch does not break others project.
   Please comment on commits what you changed for orginization.***
   

For set up, make sure you have git installed on your computer, I find it easier to use within terminal. I have a windows OS and use GitBash, but you can also use it within cmd and powershell I think(Mac you just use the terminal). Open the shell in the directory/folder you want the repo to live in, and type 'git clone "https://github.com/awainright/GameProject.git"' and press enter (This stores a copy or "clone" of the online repository on your computer). To commit changes type 'git add .' (period must be included,) then 'git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"' then 'git push'. To pull changes from repo type 'git pull'(With every new commit you should use git pull to keep your copy up to date). There are tons of commands within git, but for simplicity these are the main ones. If you want/know how to fork your own branch do so. There may be a way to integrate git within Unity but I have never done it so I can't help you there.
